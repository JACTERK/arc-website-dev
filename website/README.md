# Arc Documentation Site

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

The site contains information on how Arc runs, and how to set it up.

### Installation

```
$ yarn install
```

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Deployment is handled using a Github Action at `.github/workflows/static.yml`.
